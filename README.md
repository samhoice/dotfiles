## Installer

**NOTE** This hasn't been tested in forever, so...
install.sh will setup symlinks for all the various files


## vim

vimrc, linked into $HOME/.vim
there's also a directory symlink


## nvim

need to symlink .config/nvim to the `nvim` directory
need to symlink .local/share/nvim maybe?
